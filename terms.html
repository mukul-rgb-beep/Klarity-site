  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using Klarity, you agree to these Terms of Service. Klarity is provided "as is" without warranty. Please read these terms carefully before using the app.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. License Grant</h2>
  <p>Mukul Mehra ("Developer") grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download, install, and use Klarity ("the App") on any Apple-branded device that you own or control, subject to these terms and the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.</p>
  <p>This license is for both personal and commercial use. You may install the App on multiple devices you own using the same Apple ID.</p>

  <h2>2. Restrictions</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the App</li>
    <li>Modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works based on the App</li>
    <li>Redistribute, sublicense, lease, rent, or lend the App to third parties</li>
    <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or proprietary notices in the App</li>
    <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>Klarity, including all code, design, graphics, icons, and documentation, is the intellectual property of Mukul Mehra and is protected under applicable copyright laws. All rights not expressly granted in these terms are reserved.</p>
  <p>© 2025–2026 Mukul Mehra. All rights reserved.</p>

  <h2>4. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
  <p>The Developer does not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure. You use the App at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Loss of data, files, or disk contents</li>
    <li>Damage to hardware or software</li>
    <li>Loss of profits, revenue, or business opportunities</li>
    <li>System downtime or interruption</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Klarity is a read-only disk analyzer — it only reads file metadata (names and sizes) and does not modify, move, or delete files. However, any actions you take based on the information provided by the App are your sole responsibility.</p>

  <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
  <p>Klarity does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All disk analysis and RAM monitoring happens entirely on your device. For full details, see our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>7. Updates & Changes</h2>
  <p>The Developer may release updates to the App from time to time. These updates may include bug fixes, new features, or changes to existing functionality. We reserve the right to update these Terms of Service with new releases. Continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

  <h2>8. Termination</h2>
  <p>This license is effective until terminated. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the App and delete all copies from your devices.</p>

  <hr class="section-divider">

  <h2>9. Apple Standard EULA</h2>
  <p>Klarity is distributed through the Apple App Store and is additionally governed by Apple's Standard End-User License Agreement (EULA). In the event of any conflict between these Terms and Apple's EULA, Apple's EULA shall take precedence to the extent required.</p>

  <div class="apple-eula-box">
    <p><strong>Apple's Standard EULA applies to this App.</strong></p>
    <p>By downloading Klarity from the App Store, you also agree to Apple's Licensed Application End User License Agreement, available at:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/</a></p>
    <p>Key provisions of Apple's Standard EULA include:</p>
  </div>

  <h3>9.1 Scope of License</h3>
  <p>Apple's EULA grants you a non-transferable license to use the App on any Apple-branded device that you own or control, as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.</p>

  <h3>9.2 Maintenance and Support</h3>
  <p>The Developer is solely responsible for providing maintenance and support for the App. Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance or support services with respect to the App.</p>

  <h3>9.3 Warranty</h3>
  <p>In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the App.</p>

  <h3>9.4 Product Claims</h3>
  <p>The Developer, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims relating to the App, including but not limited to product liability claims, any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>

  <h3>9.5 Intellectual Property Claims</h3>
  <p>In the event of any third-party claim that the App infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, the Developer, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such claim.</p>

  <h3>9.6 Third-Party Beneficiary</h3>
  <p>Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary.</p>

  <hr class="section-divider">

  <h2>10. Version Scope, Updates & Future Versions</h2>

  <h3>10.1 License Scope Limited to Current Version</h3>
  <p>Your purchase of Klarity grants you a license solely for the version of the App that is available for download on the App Store at the date of purchase. This license does not entitle you to any future versions, upgrades, or successor products, whether released under the same name or a different name.</p>

  <h3>10.2 No Obligation to Provide Updates</h3>
  <p>The Developer is under no obligation to provide updates, patches, bug fixes, new features, or ongoing maintenance for the App. While the Developer may, at their sole discretion, choose to release updates or improvements, no such commitment is implied or guaranteed by your purchase.</p>

  <h3>10.3 Feature Changes & Discontinuation</h3>
  <p>The Developer reserves the right, at their sole discretion, to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add new features or functionality to the App</li>
    <li>Modify, retire, or discontinue existing features without prior notice</li>
    <li>Alter the App's design, interface, or behavior in any update</li>
    <li>Cease development or support of the App entirely</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>10.4 Future Versions & Premium Editions</h3>
  <p>The Developer may, at their sole discretion, introduce new versions, editions, forks, branches, or variants of the App — including but not limited to versions marketed as "Pro," "Premium," "Plus," or under any other designation. Such versions may be made available on the App Store as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A separate, standalone app requiring a fresh purchase at a price determined by the Developer</li>
    <li>An update to the existing App with additional features available via in-app purchase</li>
    <li>A new listing under a different name or bundle identifier</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Your existing license does not entitle you to free access to any such future version, premium edition, or in-app purchase content. Each version or edition may be subject to its own pricing, terms, and license agreement.</p>

  <hr class="section-divider">

  <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under these terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in India.</p>
